I worked on leetcode for this project. The first problem's description read: 
"Write a function createHelloWorld. It should return a new function that always returns "Hello World"
This is my solution code:
var createHelloWorld = function() {
    
    return function(...args) {
        return "Hello World"
    }
};

Problem called for function returning to "Hello World," so I provided the return function tool with "Hello World"
